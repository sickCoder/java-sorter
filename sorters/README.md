# Sorters

In this project you will find different sorting algorithms written in Java.
- Merge sort
- Insertion sort
- Bubble sort

## Merge sort

One of the most efficient sorting algorithm. The idea is to divide and conquer in order to sort an array.
It divides recursively the initial array in two halves sub arrays. It continuously splits the array in half until it cannot
be divided again (the sub arrays are empty or contain only one element). Then, the merge process begins. It takes two sorted
arrays and combines them into a larger array.

Note : If you whant to try the test file, delete the comment tokens in `MergeSorterTest.java` and comment the `private` key words before all methods in `MergeSorter.java`.
